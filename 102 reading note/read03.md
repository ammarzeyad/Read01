# *WireFrame *
  1. intro: 
 
  - Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.
 

  2. Example on WireFrame:
   - Before you start designing the wireframes of your own app or product, take a look at some examples of wireframes. This will give you some inspiration for your own wireframes, as well as giving you an idea of the variety of ways of creating them. Some people like to draw their wireframes by hand, others feel more comfortable using software like Invision, or Balsamiq to create theirs.

  3.  The best tools for wireframing:

# *HTML basics*

1.  *HTML :*

 is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.


 1. Headings:


- Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, <h1>–<h6>, 



2. Paragraphs: 

- < elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently when marking up regular text content.

3. Lists :

- A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:

- *Unordered lists* : are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a <ul> element.


- *Ordered* lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an <ol> element.

# Semantics

1.Semantics in JavaScript : 

In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an < element with that string as its textContent. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?

2.Semantics in CSS :

In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?

3.Semantics in HTML :

In HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
