# Markdown

***Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax aimed at making writing for the internet easier. The philosophy behind Markdown is that plain text documents should be readable without tags mussing everything up, but there should still be ways to add text modifiers like lists, bold, italics, etc. It is an alternative to WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors, which use rich text that later gets converted to proper HTML.***

* It’s possible you’ve encountered Markdown without realizing it. Facebook chat, Skype, and Reddit all let you use different flavors of Markdown to format your messages.

**This is some _Feature_ For Markdown:**

1 ) Links:

* You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link.

---
2 ) Nested Lists:

* You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.
To create a nested list using the web editor on GitHub or a text editor that uses a monospaced font, like Atom, you can align your list visually. Type space characters in front of your nested list item, until the list marker character (- or *) lies directly below the first character of the text in the item above it.

---
3 ) Task lists:

* To create a task list, preface list items with a regular space character followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x].

4 ) Using emoji

* You can add emoji to your writing by typing :EMOJICODE:.

---
5 ) Quoting text

* You can quote text with a >.
