# CSS

## 1. The Def

- CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors,layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments.  

## 2. How Does CSS Work?

- CSS brings style to your web pages by interacting with HTML elements. Elements are the individual HTML components of a web page—for instance a paragraph—which in HTML might look like this:

\<p>This is my paragraph!</p>
If you wanted to make this paragraph appear pink and bold to people viewing your web page through a web browser, you’d use CSS code that looks like this:
p  {  color:pink;  font-weight:bold;  }

 An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

 The internal style is defined inside the \<style> element, inside the head section.
