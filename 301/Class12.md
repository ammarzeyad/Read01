# SQL vs NoSQL

| SQL            | NoSQL        |
| :------------- | :----------: |
| 1. Relational | Non-Relational    |
| 2. Verticaly Scable | horizontally scalable |
| 3. table-based | document |
| 4. better for multi-row transactions | better for unstructured |
| 5. use structured query language | dynamic schemas for unstructured data. |

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
