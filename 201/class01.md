# HTML 

##  How PeopLe access the web:

Browsers

   People access websites using software called a web browser. Popular examples include Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, and Opera.
In order to view a web page, users might type a web address into their browser, follow a
link from another site, or use a bookmark.
Software manufacturers regularly release new versions of browsers with new features and supporting new additions to languages. It is important, however, to remember that many computer owners will not be running the latest versions of these browsers. Therefore you cannot rely on all visitors to your site being able to use the latest functionality offered in all browsers.

 devices:

  People are accessing websites on an increasing range of devices including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. It is important to remember that various devices have different screen sizes and some have faster connections to the web than others.
 
## how websItes are created ? 

 Small websites are often written just using HTML and CSS.
Larger websites — in particular those that are updated regularly and use a content management system (CMS), blogging tools, or e-commerce software — often make use of more complex technologies on the web server, but these technologies are actually used to produce HTML and CSS that is then sent to the browser. So, if your site uses these technologies, you will be able to use your new HTML and CSS knowledge to take more control over how your site looks.
Larger, more complex sites like these may use a database to store data, and programming languages such as PHP,Java, or Ruby on the web server, but you do not need to know these technologies to improve what the user see
## How The Web Work ? 
Web pages are written in text with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), then uploaded to a host computer running web server software, such as Apache or Microsoft’s IIS (Internet Information Server).
The web server sends out pages when they are requested by a web browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. The host and client communicate using an agreed ’language’ called HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). This is why web page addresses begin with http:// and so on.

## Web page structure: 
What do the New York Times, Wikipedia, Airbnb, and Lady Gaga's website have in common? They can all be broken down into predictable blocks.
I could actually name almost any website, and you could break down the site into remarkably predictable sections. Developers write HTML in a way that permits consistent content structure across the entire web. This reduces cognitive work for users and makes different sites display reliably across browsers, screen readers, and search engines.

## Basic HTML Page Structure
A basic HTML page is a document that typically has the file extension .html, though HTML frequently appears in the content of other file types as well. All HTML documents follow the same basic structure so that the browser that renders the file knows what to do. The basic structure on which all webpages are built looks like this:

## Mark up
If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters:

It is a good idea to add comments to your code because, no matter how familiar you
are with the page at the time
of writing it, when you come back to it later (or if someone else needs to look at the code), comments will make it much easier to understand.
Although comments are not visible to users in the main browser window, they can be viewed by anyone who looks at the source code behind the page.
On a long page you will often see comments used to indicate where sections of the page start or end, and to pass on notes to help anyone who is looking at the code understand it.
Comments can also be used around blocks of code to stop that code from being displayed in the browser. In the example on the left, the email link has been commented out.


## scrolling
The scrolling attribute will
not be supported in HTML5. In HTML 4 and XHTML, it indicates whether the iframe should
have scrollbars or not. This is important if the page inside the iframe is larger than the space you have allowed for it (using the height and width attributes). Scrollbars allow the user to move around the frame to see more content. It can take one of three values: yes (to show scrollbars), no (to hide scrollbars) and auto (to show them only if needed).

## frameborder
The frameborder attribute will not be supported in HTML5. In HTML 4 and XHTML, it indicates whether the frame should have
a border or not. A value of 0 indicates that no border should be shown. A value of 1 indicates that a border should be shown.
## seamless
In HTML5, a new attribute called seamless can be applied to an iframe where scrollbars are not desired. The seamless attribute (like some other new HTML5 attributes) does not need a value, but you will often see authors give it a value of seamless. Older browsers
do not support the seamless attribute.

## WireFrames: 

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.
A lot of designers will take the elements that need to appear on each page and start by creating wireframes. This involves sketching or shading areas where each element of the page will go (such as the logo, primary navigation, headings and main bodies of text, user logins etc).
By creating a wireframe you can ensure that all of the information that needs to be on a page is included.
You should not include the color scheme, font choices, backgrounds or images for the website in the wireframe. It should focus on what information needs to be on each page and create a visual hierarchy to indicate the most important parts of each page.
The wireframes make design easier because you know what information needs to appear on which page before considering
how the the page should look.
It can be very helpful to show the wireframes of a site to a client before showing them a design.
It enables the client to ensure the site has all the functions and information it needs to offer.
If you just present a site design to a client, it is common for them to focus on how the site looks, which means they may not raise issues about its function after the site has been built.
