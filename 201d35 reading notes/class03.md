# List IN HTML

## There are 3 main type for the list

1 ) Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.

\<ol> − An ordered list. This will use different schemes of numbers to list your items.

2 ) Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point .

\<ul> − An unordered list. This will list items using plain bullets.

3 ) Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

- \<dl> − A definition list. This arranges your items in the same way as they are arranged in a dictionary.

- \<dd>
This is used to contain the definition.
Sometimes you might see a list where there are two terms used for the same definition or two different definitions for the same term.

- \<dt>
This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).

## BOXEX IN HTML

## Block and inline boxes

In CSS we broadly have two types of boxes — block boxes and inline boxes. These characteristics refer to how the box behaves in terms of page flow and in relation to other boxes on the page. Boxes also have an inner display type and an outer display type. First, we will explain what we mean by block box and inline box. We will then explain what is meant by an inner and outer display type.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation).

JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!

JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort.

## Logical operators

There are four logical operators in JavaScript: || (OR), && (AND), ! (NOT), ?? (Nullish Coalescing). Here we cover the first three, the ?? operator is in the next article.

Although they are called “logical”, they can be applied to values of any type, not only boolean. Their result can also be of any type.

Let’s see the details.

## || (OR)

The “OR” operator is represented with two vertical line symbols:

result = a || b;
In classical programming, the logical OR is meant to manipulate boolean values only. If any of its arguments are true, it returns true, otherwise it returns false.

In JavaScript, the operator is a little bit trickier and more powerful. But first, let’s see what happens with boolean values
